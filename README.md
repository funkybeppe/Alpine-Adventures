# Milestone Project 1

## Purpose

This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.

## Alpine Adventures Responsive Website

The Alpine Adventures website is designed for a fictional ski club based in Sestrieres, Italy.
I came up with this idea as I am a certified Alpine ski instructor and I previously worked for a ski school in Italy.
I wanted to combine the ski world with the web develpoment one by creating a website, using the tecnical knoledge from my personal experience.

The Alpine Adventures is a landing page for beginners and intermediate mountain passionates looking for a fun way to learn how to ski or snowboard.
The Alpine Adventures mountain club offers activities such as skiing, snowboarding and hiking. Recommended minimum age of 8 years old.

Users of this website will be able to find all the information they need to know about Alpine Adventures: a brief introduction with the activities, About Us page and a form to submit with activity selection, making the communication from both ends easier and quicker.
This site is targeted towards parents of childrens and adults who want to learn how to ski.

## User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the club.
* As a First Time user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my mobile device.
* As a First Time user, I want to find ways to follow Alpine Adventures on different social media platforms.

### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning user, I want to contact the organisation so I can request more information.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The three main colours used are Navy Blue #1E3A50, mainly used for body and buttons, a Off White #fff for headings and body where more contrast with the light blue shade was needed, and the Light Blue shade rgba( 16, 87, 119, .7). The Navy Blue and Off White shades should compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes.

### Typography

The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Dosis font while the main text is using the Cairo font.

### Images

The images were all taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

### Limitations

Due to no JavaScript functionality, the contact forms will not store data.


## Features

* Navigation

  * Featured at the top of the page, the navigation shows the name of the club in the left corner: ALPINE ADVENTURES that links to the top of the page.

Testing is required on MilestoneProject 1 â€“ Alpine Adventures Responsive Website.

As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing to be done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes.

No elements should overlap another container div. All elements should remain on the screen at all sizes above 300px.

All nav links should direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

All links to external websites must open in a new browser.

Testing of form validation will also be required to ensure the correct inputs are taken and that all fields are required.

The live Project can be found [here](https://funkybeppe.github.io/Alpine-Adventures/)
